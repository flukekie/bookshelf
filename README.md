This is the source code of the new [flukekie.net](https://flukekie.net) which is based on Gatsby starter blog template thing.

The blog posts are very likely contain mostly Thai content. But have English UI for most part.

## Setup

Some classic Gatsby/React/Node app initialization

```shell
yarn install
gatsby develop
gatsby build
```

There's more to come.
